# Analysis of Renewable Energy Consumption in Europe

This project investigates long-term trends in Europe’s energy landscape, with a particular focus on the primary energy consumption coming from renewable energy sources. It uses annual data from 1985 to 2024. All datasets are publicly available through Our World in Data, Eurostat, and the Energy Institute (EI).

### Goals
The objective of this project is to strengthen my skills in Python, Jupyter Notebook, and data handling with CSV files by working through a real-world dataset.
I chose to focus on renewable energy in Europe because it is a field I am particularly interested in and one that plays a crucial role in global sustainability efforts.
This analysis aims to answer the following questions:
* What are the main energy sources in Europe?
* Where does renewable energy stand today in terms of consumption?
* How much of Europe’s energy comes from low-carbon sources?
* Which renewable energy sources are growing the fastest in terms of consumption?

### Highlights
Here are some key findings from the analysis:
* Europe’s energy system has historically been dominated by fossil fuels, with oil and gas making up the majority of primary energy consumption throughout the 20th century.
* Nuclear energy grew significantly after the 1970s oil crisis but has been declining slowly since 2004.
* Hydropower remains the largest established renewable source, though its growth is slower compared to wind/solar.
* Based on the graph and supplementary readings, the data suggests that although renewable energy technologies have made significant advancements, the transition toward a fully sustainable energy system is progressing too slowly. In 2023, renewables accounted for just 24.5% of the EU’s gross final energy consumption—still far below the 42.5% target set for 2030. To stay on track, the EU would need to nearly double its recent pace of renewable energy deployment.
* History shows that strong pro-renewable policies, sustained investment, and rapid expansion of supporting infrastructure are essential for accelerating progress toward sustainability.
